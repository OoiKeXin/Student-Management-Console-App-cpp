*This is a course project*
Implemented a student record system using binary search trees to optimize data insertion and retrieval.
Developed custom traversal methods: deepest node search, level-order printing, and subtree cloning.
Optimized tree operations to maintain log(n) complexity for search and insert in average-case scenarios.
